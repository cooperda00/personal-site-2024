_N.B. Modlify and Clinchd are two different products from the same business as a result of a pivot in early 2023._

### Project Overview

A workflow management solution leveraging AI to help businesses eliminate inefficiencies and foster collaboration in a transparent environment.

### Key Contributions

- Delivered full-stack features end-to-end using __TypeScript__, __React__, __Apollo GraphQL__, __NestJS__, and __PostgreSQL__.
- Selected and integrated third-party providers for key features like notifications, CSV import, and onboarding flows, enabling the team to focus on core app features.
- Optimised AI prompt performance for our specific use case, resulting in more accurate and thorough responses.
